# House of Resell Review – Is This Discord Group Worth Your Investment?

Making money from reselling has become popular over the last few years. People are buying sneakers, toys, tickets, and other items to sell them for a profit. But with so many Discord groups out there, it's hard to know which ones actually work.

I've been testing House of Resell for three months now. Here's my honest review about whether this UK reselling group is worth your money.

## What Is House of Resell?

### Overview of the Platform

House of Resell calls itself the UK's first reselling group. They've been around for over 10 years, which is pretty impressive in this business. The group works through Discord, where you get alerts about items you can buy and sell for profit.

What makes them different? They don't use other companies to find deals. Their own team looks for opportunities, which means you get access to items that other groups don't know about.

### Who Created House of Resell?

A guy named Manny started House of Resell. He's been in the reselling game for over 10 years and also created other popular tools like CarnageBot and Arbitrage University. 

Manny and his team work full-time finding profitable items for members. They don't rely on outside sources, which is why they can offer exclusive deals.

### Types of Items You Can Flip

House of Resell covers pretty much everything:
- **Sneakers**: Limited releases and restocks
- **Concert and sports tickets**
- **Toys and collectibles**
- **Amazon items with pricing errors**

- **Random profitable items**: From household goods to electronics

## How Does House of Resell Work?

**Ticket Hub**: From finding out about sales to actually buying tickets, they help with everything. They even have bots that tell you when profitable tickets come back in stock.

**NFT Hub**: Yes, people still make money from NFTs. Their team researches every release and tells you which ones are worth buying.
